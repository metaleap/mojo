# Milestone 01: Infancy.

## Atmo user language:

- functions:
  - nullary to n-ary
  - recursion
  - but no closures, partial application, or higher order yet
- operators:
  - comparison: `==`
  - branching: `?-` with `|-`
- types:
  - "tags": like Lisp's symbols, Erlang's atoms etc.
    - any `#tagged` token becomes an expression of "_tag_ shape"
    - tags `#true` and `#false` are produced by the comparison operators and accepted by conditionals

## Atmo core language:

- types:
  - `@Sym`
    - used for tags
    - storage spec: `int` that's `unsigned` and with `bit-width` sized for number of unique tags occurring in program
      - we have no notion of "int"s yet (or signed-ness), other than as a moniker we know our low-level compilation targets understand as a sized notion for storage
- ops:
  - `@cmpi (op:#eq, lhs:@Sym, rhs:@Sym) -> #true | #false`
  - `@cond (scrut:@Sym, matchees:[@Sym], results:[@Sym], default:?@Sym) -> @Sym`
  - `@tmpRndSym () -> @Sym`
    - temporary helper (will be removed later on)
      - to get some quasi-nondeterministic "runtime-only" not-statically-reducable value-producer in from the start
    - generates runtime `rand()` call within range of program's full set of symbols excluding both `#true` and `#false`
  - (notation above for prim-op args / returns is ad-hoc and sub-precise and not of-the-language because our type system isn't ripe enough yet)

## Scenarios:

Given:

```dart
isWeekend1 day :=
  day ?-  #sun  =>  #true   // no sugar yet for multiple ..
      |-  #sat  =>  #true   //  .. comparees in single case
      |-  _     =>  #false

isWeekend2 day :=           // no ternary-sugar yet
  (day == #sun) ?-  #true   =>  #true         // no `||` yet
                |-  #false  =>  (day == #sat)

isWeekend3 day :=   // sour, but sugar comes later
  day ?-  #sun  =>  #true
      |-  #sat  =>  #true
      |-  #mon  =>  #false
      |-  #tue  =>  #false
      |-  #sat  =>  #true   // marked unreachable
      |-  #wed  =>  #false
      |-  #thu  =>  #false
      |-  #fri  =>  #false

isWeekday day :=
  isWeekend3 foo // error: 'isWeekend3' undefined for 'day' values of 'foo'
  foo := isWeekend2 day

notEq tag1 tag2 :=
  not (tag1 == tag2) // asserts set-overlap between operands

not b := // no `/=` sugar yet
  b ?- #true => #false |- #false => #true

not2 b :=
  b ?- not #false => not #true
    |- #true      => #true     // error: contradictory
    |- #true      => #false    // marked unreachable

rndDay1 weekend :=
  isWeekend3 rnd_day  ?- weekend  => rnd_day
                      | _         => rndDay weekend
  rnd_day := @tmpRndSym ()

rndDay2 weekend :=
  not (@tmpRndSym ()) // error: 'not' undefined for 'b' values of '@tmpRndSym ()'

rndDay3 weekend :=
  #false == (@tmpRndSym ()) // error: no set-overlap of operands
    ?- #true  => rndDay2 weekend
    |- _      => rndDay1 weekend

rndDay4 weekend :=
  notEq (isWeekend3 (rndDay1 weekend)) (@tmpRndSym ()) // error: no overlap between '(isWeekend3 (rndDay1 weekend))' values and '@tmpRndSym ()' values

rndDay5 weekend := // offer: simplify to `rndDay1 weekend`
  #false
    ?- #true => rndDay2 weekend // marked unreachable
    |- _ => rndDay1 weekend
```

... we want the core lang to "spec" these functions out roughly as follows (only some examples, not all functions covered).

### `isWeekend3`:
  - `day` assertion: `==#sun || ==#sat || ==#mon || ==#tue || ==#wed || ==#thu || ==#fri`
  - return guarantee: `==#true || ==#false`

(Again, ad-hoc syntax not of-the-language yet, there's no actual `||` for one.)

Actually must come out much more refined than outlined above. The "spec" produced would actually have to be (symbolically / approximately) as detailed as the definition itself &mdash; in fact here exactly-equal because all values are statically-known, however in more runtime-known-values-dominant scenarios still more verbose than the code itself, as all accumulated factoids (tree of predicates) are captured per each individual expression &mdash; but for now let's first digest this "simpler spec-ing" formulated above as a first rough idea of what's in store eventually.

### `isWeekend2` and `isWeekend3`:

  - return guarantee: `==#true || ==#false`
  - `day` assertion: `@Any`

Note that in this milestone, `@Any` is equivalent to `@Sym`, which for now is the entirety of the (user-accessible) type universe.

This style of generic-catch-all will eventually be discouraged once cleaner more restrictive and more precise formulations become, through sugars, even more convenient for the programmer than adding a catch-all default match.

### `isWeekday`:

  - `foo` assertion: `==#true || ==#false`
  - `day` assertion: `@Any`
  - return guarantee: (invalid)
    - could lazily just propagate `isWeekend3`'s return guarantee for now.. but should get this "unspecable" diagnosis in from the start

## Sema = abstract-interp/partial-eval

The above must and can really only be the outcome of ongoing atmo-tailored live semantic analysis (sema) that approximately implements somewhat abstract/symbolic interpretation and somewhat partial evaluation.

Consider first that most-all real-world functions (excepting a handful of FP-style simpletons like `id`/`const` or Church-encodings) call other functions and/or prim-ops (whose "specs" are pre-defined / hardwired / axiomatic / non-derived).

It is to be understood that during sema, any function call encountered instantiates a "call-specific function specialization" expansion of the callee. Thus we traverse depth-first into the graph until reaching some "leaf functions": all those that lack function calls themselves.

- Reach a **leaf function**:
  - regardless of the caller from which we just first reached it, immediately the "generic baseline instance" (ie. _no actual "specialization" at all_ in the usual meaning of the phrase) is ensured &mdash; one where all args are considered runtime-known.
    - still there might be statically reducable exprs, they are immediately reduced
    - usage of args with prim-ops determines their first "facts" / assertions / constraints
    - determine the set of arg-set/return-set combinations
- Back up to the callsite in non-leaf function:
  - Add now-available-from-the-callee constraints on all arg exprs to the set of whatever constraints they already had
- Once all constraints on all sub-expressions gathered:
  - Only now check for contradictions / impossibilities
  - Gather calls that can be specialized: those where any arg expr has more detailed constraints than the callee's "generic baseline instance" asserts
  - Instantiate specializations: track if any change from baseline in structure or in arg/ret asserts, refine exprs affected by the switch to the specialized-instance, reprocess what's affected by _those_ refinements, etc.

This all must be in the form of a node-walking evaluator with:

  - added support for "hole values" that have the "interpretative effect" of accumulating predicates / assertions on that expr
  - online checks for violations of the predicates established on sub-exprs wrt their uses
    - similar to how most interpreted languages catch-and-throw type errors "at runtime" (eval time), this evaluator likewise does at _its_ "interpretation time" which happens to be our "static semantic analysis time"
