Zen of EWD1130:

1. adopt a notation that captures what is essential and nothing more
2. restrict reasoning steps to a well-defined _and_ modest repertoire of manipulations
3. adopt a notation that yields formulae well-geared to our manipulative needs
4. do not sacrifice ease of manipulation to brevity
5. restrict to unambiguous formulae

Stretch goal: iterate later towards increasing "amenability to uninterpreted manipulation":

> It is paralyzing. A calculus really helps us [..] by the eminently feasible manipulation
> of formulae whose interpretation in terms of a model completely defies our powers of
> imagination. Insistence on constant interpretation rules out effective use of the calculus.

"Constant interpretation" being (for us) the incessant laborious "running the code in the mind".
