the cell model (simplified) of data/type primitives, to be used as a starting point:
    () = any
    atoms:
        float
        int
        tags
    composites:
        # tagged foo
        [] sequence of foo
            [,] n-ary tuple = fixed-length heterogenous sequence
            string: tagged list of int32
        {} relations:
            unary: set of foos
            binary: set of len-2 tuples, and optionally map or record semantics
            n-ary: set of len-n tuples
